Thank you for your interest in contributing to coginivise! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## Code of Conduct

This project follows a code of conduct that we expect all contributors to adhere to. Please be respectful and constructive in all interactions.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- npm or yarn
- VS Code
- Git

### Development Setup

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/coginivise.git
   cd coginivise
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Compile the extension:
   ```bash
   npm run compile
   ```

5. Open the project in VS Code and press F5 to run the extension in a new Extension Development Host window

## Making Changes

### Branch Naming
Use descriptive branch names:
- `feature/description` for new features
- `fix/description` for bug fixes
- `docs/description` for documentation changes
- `refactor/description` for code refactoring

### Code Style

- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Maintain consistent indentation (2 spaces)
- Follow the existing code structure

### Testing

Before submitting a pull request:
1. Run the test suite: `npm test`
2. Test the extension manually in VS Code
3. Verify that new features work as expected
4. Ensure no regressions in existing functionality

## Adding New Security Rules

### YAML Rules (Semgrep)
Add new patterns to `rules/hardcoded-secrets.yml`:

```yaml
- id: new-vulnerability
  patterns:
    - pattern: |
        $PATTERN_HERE
  message: "Description of the vulnerability"
  languages: [javascript, typescript]
  severity: WARNING
```

### TypeScript Detection
Add corresponding regex patterns in `src/extension.ts`:

```typescript
const newPatterns = [
    /pattern1/i,
    /pattern2/i
];
```

### QuickFix Support
Add QuickFix handling in the `SecurityCodeActionProvider`:

```typescript
else if (diag.code === 'coginivise.new_vulnerability') {
    const fix = new vscode.CodeAction('Fix description', vscode.CodeActionKind.QuickFix);
    // Implementation
}
```

## Adding New Vulnerability Types

1. **Define the vulnerability** in the YAML rules file
2. **Implement detection logic** in TypeScript
3. **Add QuickFix support** for automated fixes
4. **Update documentation** with examples
5. **Add test cases** to verify detection

## Documentation

When adding new features:
- Update the README.md with usage examples
- Add entries to CHANGELOG.md
- Include inline code comments
- Update any relevant documentation files
